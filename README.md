This repository serves as a living document of my commitment to consistent practice and deep learning. I'm Yash Singhal (@VITianYash42), a Computer Science student on a mission to become a proficient Full-Stack Software Developer.

🎯 My Goals for This Challenge
Master Core DSA: To build an unshakable foundation in fundamental data structures and algorithms.

Enhance C++ Proficiency: To write clean, efficient, and optimal C++ code.

Develop Problem-Solving Mindset: To improve my ability to analyze problems and devise effective solutions.

Build Consistency: To prove to myself and future employers that I am a disciplined and dedicated developer.

Create a Public Portfolio: To showcase a tangible body of work demonstrating my skills.

🚀 Progress Tracker
Here is the log of my daily progress. Each entry includes a link to the complete, runnable C++ solution.

<!--
INSTRUCTIONS FOR YASH:

For each new day, add a new row to this table.

Create a folder for the day (e.g., Day001_Second_Largest).

Place your solution.cpp file inside that folder.

Update the Link to Solution path to point to your new file.

Change the Status to ✅ when done!
